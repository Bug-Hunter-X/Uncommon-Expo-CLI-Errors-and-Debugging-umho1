Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Examine the Full Error Message:** Carefully review the entire error message, including stack traces.  Look for clues about the specific file, line number, and the nature of the problem.
2. **Check Package.json:** Ensure all dependencies and devDependencies are correctly specified and compatible with each other and the Expo SDK version.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` to clean the project and then rebuild it using `expo start`.
4. **Check Expo Go:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo Go app installed. Restart the app and your device.
5. **Inspect the Expo Server Logs:**  The Expo development server logs often provide valuable debugging information.
6. **Test in a New Project:** Create a fresh new Expo project to check if the problem is related to your existing project configuration or code.
7. **Verify Node.js and npm versions:** Ensure that your Node.js and npm versions are appropriate and up-to-date for the Expo SDK version you're using.
8. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums (Stack Overflow, Expo forums) for similar error messages or issues.  Providing detailed information about your environment, setup and error message often gets you fast help. 
9. **Check your config files:** Carefully examine the `app.json` (or `expo.json`) and `metro.config.js` files for any syntax errors or misconfigurations.
10. **Update your expo-cli and expo:**  Running `npm update expo cli` and then `expo upgrade` ensures you have the latest versions.
